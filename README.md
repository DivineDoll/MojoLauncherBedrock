DivineLauncher is an unofficial Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android with a Bedrock-style interface, an instance manager, themes, screen recorder, gamepad support and MobileGlues support.

It is a fork of [MojoLauncher](https://github.com/MojoLauncher/MojoLauncher), which is based on [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher). It is not made, approved or affiliated with Mojang Studios or Microsoft.

## Getting DivineLauncher
Build it from source (see below) or download the APK from the GitHub Actions of this repository.

## Building   
* Build the launcher (it will automatically download all required components)
```
./gradlew :app_mojo:assembleDebug
```
If you are building on Windows:
* Replace `./gradlew` with `.\gradlew.bat`
* Make sure `mojoexec`, `sdl`, `glfw` are symlinked into `app_pojavlauncher/src/main/jni/`

## Known Issues
- Some physical mice may have very slow mouse speed
- On Holy GL4ES, large texture atlases may be distorted (resulting in stretched/blocky textures in modpacks)
- Probably more, that's why we have a bug tracker ;)
